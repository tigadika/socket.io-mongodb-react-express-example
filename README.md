# Build chatapp

With socket.io and mongodb by using React and express

## Installation

- Make sure you have mongodb installed in your computer
- open server, npm i then npm run dev
- open client, npm i then npm run dev
- enjoy euy!

## Another Thing

If you want to integrate like this to your application, you don't really need mongoDB per se, you can use another database to your liking, like SQLite, or even PostgreSQL! We need database just only to persist the history/chat information so that another user join the room have previous chat
